# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Removed Redundant Files**
   - Removed duplicate Python files from the root directory
   - Kept only essential entry points at the root level (main.py, run.py)
   - Cleaned up old templates and static directories

2. **Organized Code Structure**
   - All code now properly organized in the csv_to_iceberg package
   - Maintained proper separation of concerns with modules for:
     - Core functionality
     - CLI interface
     - Web interface
     - Storage management
     - Connectors

3. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Created symlink (csv_to_iceberg.py -> run.py) to maintain compatibility with workflows
   - Kept essential entry points like main.py and run.py at the root level

4. **Working Components**
   - Web application functioning correctly
   - CLI tool operational with proper --help output
   - Job management system functioning properly
   - LMDB storage working for job persistence

## Testing Performed

1. **Web Interface Testing**
   - Verified jobs listing page works
   - Created and retrieved test job successfully
   - Confirmed all templates and routes are working

2. **CLI Tool Testing**
   - Verified the CLI workflow runs successfully
   - Confirmed help text is displayed properly

3. **Job Management Testing**
   - Added test job through script
   - Verified job persistence in LMDB storage
   - Confirmed job retrieval works

## Next Steps

1. Merge the cleanup-repository branch to main
2. Continue with planned feature development
3. Consider adding more automated tests to ensure code quality

## Benefits of the Cleanup

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner structure makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain
2. **Better Organization**: Proper package structure follows Python best practices
3. **Simplified Development**: Clear separation of concerns makes feature development easier
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant code and files
